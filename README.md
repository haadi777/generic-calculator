This Python program implements a generic calculator that can perform addition on numbers of various bases, including binary (base 2), decimal (base 10), octal (base 8), and hexadecimal (base 16). The core functionality of the calculator is encapsulated in the Solution class, which contains the method gen_Cal to handle the addition process.
How It Works
1. Number System Dictionaries

The program begins by defining a dictionary, for_Hexa, to map hexadecimal characters to their integer values. Another dictionary, reversed_Hexa, is created by reversing the key-value pairs of for_Hexa for converting integer results back to the appropriate base notation.
2. Input Handling

The numbers to be added are taken as string inputs, which are then prefixed with a '0' to handle potential leading zeros. The inputs are converted into lists of their integer equivalents based on the provided base.
3. Length Adjustment

The program ensures that the two numbers are of equal length by padding the shorter number with leading zeros.
4. Addition Logic

The program performs addition digit by digit from the least significant to the most significant digit (right to left), implementing carry-over logic. It uses the floor function from the math library to compute the carry-out value. The results are stored in a list, which is reversed at the end to get the final result in the correct order.
5. Base Conversion

The resultant list of integers is converted back to the appropriate characters (if necessary, for bases higher than 10) using the reversed_Hexa dictionary.
6. Output

The final result is concatenated into a string and printed. If the first number is not greater than or equal to the second number, the program prompts the user to retry.
7. User Interface

A simple menu-driven interface is provided for the user to choose the type of addition (binary, decimal, octal, or hexadecimal) or to exit the program.
